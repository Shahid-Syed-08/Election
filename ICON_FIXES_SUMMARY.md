# 🔧 Icon Visibility Fixes - Complete

## ✅ **Problem Identified**
The icons weren't showing because the **Lucide JavaScript library wasn't properly initialized** on most pages.

## 🔧 **Root Cause**
- Pages had `data-lucide` attributes but were missing the actual Lucide JavaScript library
- Some pages had incomplete initialization scripts
- The CSS was loaded but the JavaScript to render the icons was missing

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### **1. Added Lucide JavaScript Library to All Pages**
Added this script block to every HTML file:
```html
<!-- Initialize Lucide Icons -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/lucide@latest/dist/umd/lucide.js"></script>
<script>
    // Initialize all icons
    lucide.createIcons();
</script>
```
